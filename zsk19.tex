\begin{abstract}

Emissions trading within the Emissions Trading Scheme of the European Union (EU ETS) influences European industrial companies since 2005. The companies must choose their strategy how to reduce the costs of emissions allowances as possible. The changing system’s conditions and volatile price of allowances make this decision very tough. Despite several studies devoted to the relationship between the EU ETS and companies have already been published, there is still a gap in this field. Namely, the published studies have been substantially simplified so far, e.g., by ignoring the risk of driving parameters (prices of products, or allowances), omiting existence of derivatives on allowances, or taking only one decision period into consideration. In this paper, we provide a complex stochastic optimization model, which avoids the mentioned simplifications. The resulting optimization model is a large scale stochastic optimization model requiring an efficient algorithm to be solved in reasonable time. Namely, we use the Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming algorithm (SDDP) to find the optimal solution. The model is verified using the data of a real-life industrial company for XX periods. 

%The results show that ... TBD.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:1}

Emissions trading within the European Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) is the main tool of the EU environmental policy since 2005. Rules and settings of the EU ETS are given by several EU directives, namely \citet{DIR1}, \citet{DIR4}, \citet{DIR3} and \citet{DIR9}. This system is based on obligation for companies to use emission allowances (EUAs) to cover their CO$_2$ emissions, thus it is a source of additional financial risk and costs related with trading the allowances. Many studies have been already devoted to analysis of the EU ETS' impact on companies with the same results -- this effect cannot be ommited and should be involved in strategic planning, see \citet{zhang},\citet{SMI}, or \citet{anor}. This is even enhanced by several external shocks, changes in the trading rules for the next trading periods, and trends in heavy industry, which, all together, resulting in rapid increase in allowance prices during 2017 and 2018.

Up to now, each published model optimizing the behaviour of industrial companies regarding the emissions trading has always been simplified at least at one important factor identified by \citet{anor}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[a)] multi-period environment allowing for use of banking (transfering the allowances to following time periods);
\item[b)] uncertain demand for products (the demand is a crucial factor for production, and thus for amount of emissions too);
\item[c)] uncertain EUA price (since the EU ETS is a cap-and-trade system, the allowance price is essential);
\item[d)] involving all available derivatives for allowances (futures and options).
\end{enumerate}

\end{table}


Tab. \ref{tab1} provides a review of the available models and their simplifying assumprions, according to the list above. The simplifications can stem from two main reasons. First, the authors established their model under the conditions valid at that time considering both, rules of the EU ETS and state of economy. For instance, financial derivatives could not be used by companies in the beginning of the EU ETS, banking of allowances was not allowed between the first (2005-2008) and the second (2009-2012) trading phase, see \citet{zapletal3}, and during the deep economic crisis the companies generated rather the profit than additional loss from emissions trading, due to very low levels of demands and EUA price. Second, the authors were aware of all the mentioned factors, but they have decided for simplifications just to keep the size of the models small enough to be still solvable, like in the case of \citet{anor}.

In this paper, we establish a complex stochastic optimization model involving the factors (a)-(d). This model is big enough to be solved using the standard algorithms of sochastic programming. Therefore, we apply the Stochastic Dual Dynamic algorithm, which solves a sample average approximation of large stochastic programming models efficiently, see \citet{pereira1991multi}. Moreover, we work with the latest available input data (till 12/2018), which even increase credibility of the results. 

The proposed model is applied to one real-world Czech steel company, for which we explore the impact of the factors (a)-(d) on costs of emissions trading and the associated financial risk. Furthermore, we focus on optimal portfolio of emission allowances and impact of the emissions trading on production of the modelled company. This analysis is also supported by sensitivity analysis performed for the selected inpiut values. 

%The results show that...TBD.

%The rest of this paper is organized as follows. 


\section*{Description of the problem}

A steel company decides on ways of covering their emissions $Y_{1},\dots,Y_{T}$ stemming from their exogenously given production, at times $1,\dots,T$,
by a single type of allowances. At each $t=1,\dots,T$, $r_{t}$ allowances
is given (grandfathered) to the company for free. Further, allowances
may be bought (sold) at a secondary market at any time $t=0,\dots,T$.
The allowances may be saved (banked) for future periods. 

In addition to the spots, at each $t=0,\dots,T-1,$ futures with maturities
$t+1,t+2.\dots.T,$ may be bought. Moreover, at each $t=0,\dots,T-1$, call options with maturities $t+1,t+2.\dots.T,$
and strike prices $K_{1},\dots,K_{\kappa}$ may be bought at $t$.
In principle, the options
need not be exercised at the time of their maturity; however, as we neglect transaction costs, exercising only some options is
always no worse than exercising all options and possibly selling the
difference, so we may assume all the options are exercised. The company may trade with the allowances and their derivatives freely; however, they may no take short positions.

%The company may fund their emission trading by loans with an interest
%rate $\varrho$. The insufficiency of cash at $T$ is penalized by
%a prohibitive interest rate $\iota$.

The company is risk-averse minimizing the discounted nested mean-CVaR
risk measure, applied to the differences of profits from the production and the costs of emission trading. 

\subsection*{Problem definition}


The subject of decision is the way of optimal emission trading. In particular, at $t$, it is the number $\Delta s_{t}$ of
the spot allowances purchased/sold at $t$, the numbers $$\Delta f_{t}=(\Delta f_{t}^{t+1},\dots,\Delta f_{t}^{T})$$
of the futures with maturities $t+1,\dots,T$ purchased/sold, and the numbers 
\[
\Delta \phi_{t}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\Delta \phi_{t}^{t+1,1} & \dots & \Delta \phi_{t}^{T,1}\\
\vdots &  & \vdots\\
\Delta \phi_{t}^{t+1,\kappa,} & \dots & \Delta \phi_{t}^{T,\kappa}
\end{array}\right]
\]
of the call options purchased/sold; here, $\Delta \phi_t^{\tau,i}$ denotes the number of call options with maturity $\tau$ and strike price $K_i$.

At $t=0$, the income of the company is
$$
y_0=-P_0\Delta s_0- \sum_{\tau=1}^{T}\sum_{i=1}^{\kappa}B_0^{\tau,i}\Delta \phi_0^{\tau,i},
$$
while, at any $0<t\leq T$, the income is
$$
y_t  =X_t-P_t \Delta s_t-\sum_{i=1}^{\kappa}\min(P_t,K_{i})\phi_{t-1}^{t,i}
-\sum_{\tau=0}^{t-1}Q_{\tau}^{t}\Delta f_{\tau}^t-\sum_{\tau=t+1}^{T}\sum_{i=1}^{\kappa}B_t^{\tau,i}\Delta\phi_t^{\tau-t,i}.
$$
Here, $f_t=\sum_{\tau=0}^t \Delta f^t_\tau$ and 
$\phi_t=\sum_{\tau=0}^t \Delta \phi_\tau^t$. Further, $X_t\in \R_+$ is the profit from the production at time $t$, $Y_t \in \R_+$ is the amount of the emissions at $t$, $P_t\in\R_{+}$ is the spot price at time $t$, $Q_t^\tau \in \R_+$ is the price of the future with maturity $\tau$ at time $t$, and $B_t^{\tau,i}\in \R_+$ is the premium paid at $t$ for the call option with strike price $K_i$ and maturity $\tau$. 

The aim of the company is to minimize $\rho(-y_0,\dots,-y_T)$
where $\rho$ is the nested mean-CVaR criterion; in particular, for any real $c_0,\dots,c_T$,
$$
\rho(c_0,\dots,c_T)=\mu_1(\mu_2(\dots\mu_T(c_0+\varrho c_1+\dots+\varrho ^ T c_T)\dots));
$$
where $\mu_t(Z)=(1-\lambda)\E(Z|\F_{t-1})+\lambda \mathrm{CVaR}_\alpha(Z|\F_{t-1})$, $0\leq \lambda \leq 1$ and $0<\alpha<1$ are constants and $\varrho$ is a discount factor.

Next we reformulate the decision problem into a form, which is more convenient for computation. 

Denote $e_t$ the amount of the allowances held (immediately after) $t$. Clearly, $e_0=\Delta s_0$ and 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:e}
e_t = e_{t-1}+\Delta s_t+r_t +
f_{t-1}^t+\sum_{i=1}^{\kappa}\phi_{t-1}^{t,i}-Y_t,
\end{equation}
As $\Delta f^t_\tau=f^t_\tau-f^t_{\tau-1}$, and similarly $\phi$, and as $\Delta s$ may be expressed from (\ref{eq:e}), we can alternatively take $e,f,\phi$ as decision variables. Further, as, at any $t$, the payment for futures with maturity $t$ is equal to $\sum_{\tau=0}^{t-1} b_\tau$ where $b_\tau \in  \F_\tau$, we may assume, without a change of the decision criterion's value, that $\varrho^{t-\tau}c_\tau$ is paid at each $0\leq \tau < T$ instead of the whole amount at $t$.

Consequently, the problem may be reformulated as
\[
\min_{x_{t}\in\X_{t},x_t \in \F_t 0\leq t\leq T}\rho\left(-z_{0},\dots,-z_{T}\right)
\]
where $\F_t$ is the filtration induced by process
$\xi_{t}=(X_{t},Y_{t},P_{t},Q_{t},B_t)$, where
$$
\X_{t}=\{(e_{t}, f_{t},\phi_{t}): e_0 \geq 0, f_0\geq0,
\phi_{0} \geq0.\},\qquad 0\leq t < T,$$
$$
\X_T = \{e_T:e_T=0\},
$$
and
$$
z_0=-P_0e_0-\sum_{\tau=1}^{T}\varrho^{\tau}Q_0^{\tau} f_0^{\tau}-  \sum_{\tau=1}^{T}\sum_{i=1}^{\kappa}B_0^{\tau,i}\phi_0^{\tau,i}, 
$$
\begin{multline*}
z_t  =X_t-P_t 
\left(
e_t -e_{t-1}-r_t-
f_{t-1}^t-\sum_{i=1}^{\kappa}\phi_{t-1}^{t,i}+Y_t
\right)
\\
-\sum_{i=1}^{\kappa}\min(P_t,K_{i})\phi_{t-1}^{t,i}
-\sum_{\tau=t+1}^{T}\varrho^{\tau-t}Q_t^{\tau}(f_t^{\tau-t}
-f_{t-1}^{\tau-t})
\\-\sum_{\tau=t+1}^{T}\sum_{i=1}^{\kappa}B_t^{\tau,i}
(\phi_t^{\tau-t,i}-\phi_{t-1}^{\tau-t,i}),\qquad 0<t\leq T.
\end{multline*}



\section{Data}

$T=0$ odpovídá začátku 2018, $T=3$ (end of 2020)

For the spot prices $P$ and the spreads $Q$ we adopt model from (anor). In particular, we fit the evolution of $P$ by 
\[
P_{t}=P_{0}\exp\left\{ \sum\nolimits_{\tau=1}^t u_{\tau} \right\},
\qquad u_t \sim \mathcal{N}\left(
-\frac{\sigma^2}{2},\sigma^2
\right),\qquad 1\leq t \leq T, 
\]
with $\sigma=0.439$ where $u_{1},\dots,u_T$ are i.i.d., and
\[
Q^\tau_{t}=P_t\exp\{(\tau-t)(0.00974+v^\tau_{t})\},\qquad v^\tau_{t}\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\varsigma^2),\qquad 1\leq t< \tau,\quad 1\leq \tau \leq T,
	\]
with $\varsigma=0.010$ where $v^2_1,v_1^3,v_2^3,\dots$ are i.i.d., independent of $u_1,\dots,u_T$.

The initial prices are equal to 
$$P_0=7.77, \quad Q^1_0=7.81,\quad Q^2_0=7.87,\quad Q^3_0=7.97$$ %markets.businessinsider.com

Option prices $B^{\tau,i}_t$ are computed by the Black-Scholes formula with the implied volatility being a quadratic function of the strike price relative to the spot price. The shape of the function, depicted in Picture XX, has been estimated using 110 observations of actual option prices on ???market. As the risk-less rate ??? was taken.

Our model of profits $X$ and emissions $Y$ was estimated using their monthly hypothetical historical values from 2014 to 2016, which were constructed as follows.

According to the expert in steel industry, the unit profit for steel products is influenced mainly by costs of inputs, namely, costs of coal, scrap and iron ore. The expertise showed that these three inputs represent approximately three quarters of variable costs of a steel company. Since we know the real values of selling prices and variable costs in 2014, we use the historical market data on costs of the mentioned three inputs, price indices for flat products, long products and steel semiproducts to estimate the values of unit profits, see (\ref{XX}).

\begin{equation}
x_{i,t}=p_i^* \cdot \bar{P}_t^{\bullet} - c_i^* \cdot \bigl(\rho^{O}\cdot\bar{C}_t^{O}+\rho^{S}\cdot\bar{C}_t^{S}+\rho^{I}\cdot\bar{C}_t^{I}+(1-\rho^{S}-\rho^{O}-\rho^{I})\bigr)
\label{XX}
\end{equation}
$\bullet\in\{F,L,M\}$ represents type of a steel product -- flat, long, or semiproduct, respectively; $\rho^S,\rho^O,\rho^I$ stand for a share of influence of scrap, coal and iron ore on total variable costs, respectively; $\bar{C}_t^{S},\bar{C}_t^{O},\bar{C}_t^{I}$ are costs levels for scrap, coal and iron ore at time $t$, adjusted with respect to the last known real value using (\ref{XX2}); $\bar{P}_t^{\bullet}$ is a selling price of particular steel product type at time $t$, adjusted in the same manner as the costs ($\bar{C}_t$); $p_i^*$ and $c_i^*$ are the last known real values of selling prices and variables costs of particular steel products of the modelled company (in 2014). 

\begin{equation}
\bar{C}_t^{\circ}=\frac{C_t^{\circ}}{c^{\circ *}},
\label{XX2}
\end{equation}
where $c^{\circ *}$ is a price level for commodity $\circ\in\{S,C,O\}$ in 12/2014 and $C_t^{\bullet}$ stands for a price level of this commodity at time $t$.

The time series of prices come from the Czech Steel Union's database. The expert has recommended to set $\rho^S=\rho^O=\rho^I=0.25$. This means that one quarter of variable costs of production is influenced by other factors (than the three considered raw materials), like labour costs, etc. In this study, this one quarter is taken as constant in time for the sake of simplicity.  


As all the correlations of any of $X_t,Y_t$ with any of $P_t$, $P_{t-1}$  and correlations of any of $\Delta X_t,\Delta Y_t$ with any of $\Delta P_t$, $\Delta P_{t-1}$ are insignificant, we model $X,Y$ alone, independently of $P$. The time series plots and xy--plots of processes $X_t,Y_t$ and the processes of their first differences can be seen in Figures:

\pgfimage[width=5cm]{tsplot}
\pgfimage[width=5cm]{dtsplot}


\pgfimage[width=5cm]{xyplot}
\pgfimage[width=5cm]{dxyplot}

In can be clearly seen that the values of $X_t$ and $Y_t$ ``go along'' as well as their first differences, so it is worth to model their evolution jointly. As the ADF tests rejected unit root hypothesis for both the series, we chose VAR model with the single lag to fit their time evolution:
\begin{equation}\label{xymodel}
\begin{aligned}
X_t&=2306	.45 +   1.26237 X_{t-1}  -0.158943 Y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t \\
Y_t&=12852.2  +   2.24683  X_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
with $\mathrm{stdev}(\epsilon_1)=809.6647$, $\mathrm{stdev}(\varepsilon_1)=4882.004$ and $\mathrm{corr}(\epsilon_1,\varepsilon_1)=0.907$. Highly improbable negative observations are truncated to zero, if they appear during the computation. 

The initial values 
$$
X_0 = 2744.83,\qquad Y_0 = 18982.64
$$
were obtained by a year-ahead forecast in (\ref{xymodel}).

Oba modely znovu odhadnu, ale asi by to chtělo z čerstvějších dat, takže bych poprosil spoty a futury až do konce 2017, nemusejí být moc do minulosti, stačí rok dva (denních dat)

Nově máme
\begin{itemize}
\item $B$ - opce. Tady bych poprosil o odhad tebe (nikdy jsem to nedělal, tak to vyjde nastejno:-)). Rámocový postup: vzít historické ceny opcí, vyjádřit si jejich cenu pomocí black scholese s neznámou volatilitou a pak tu volatilitu nastavit tak, aby seděla (výsledku se říká implikovaná volatilita). Jako bezrizikový výnos lze vzít některou úrokovou sazbu ČNB. Pokud bude implikovaná volatilita pro jednotlivé strike ceny hodně jiná, bude se muset udělat něco jako "adjust for smile effect". Výsledkem bude vzoreček, do kterého pak já dosadím spot cenu a strike cenu, a on mmi vyhodí cenu opce. V nesnázích by asi bylo možné obrátit se na Tomáše Tichého (kdyžtak zprostředkuju)
\item $X_t$, $Y_t$:  tohle je na vás. Protože se ani $X_t$ ani $Y_t$ nenásobí s jinou rozhodovací proměnnou, může se udělat trik, že se $X$ a $Y$ budou považovat za rozhodovací proměnnou a tím se může zachovat stagewise independence. 

Můžeme mít například
$$
(X_t,Y_t)' = A (X_{t-1},Y_{t-1})' + b P_{t-1} +  c P_t + \epsilon_t, 
$$
kde $A \in \R^{2 \times 2}$, $b,c \in \R^{1\times 2}$ a $\epsilon_t$ jsou i.i.d.
(tam by bylo $\zeta_t = (X_t,Y_t)', \zeta_t = r_{t-1}+c P_t + \epsilon_t$, $r_{t-1}= A \zeta_{t-1} + b P_{t-1}$), 

Nebo třeba
$$
(X_t,Y_t)'= A(X_{t-1},Y_{t-1})' P^\alpha_{t-1} P^\beta_t  \epsilon_t
$$
$\alpha,\beta \geq 0$ (tam by bylo $\zeta_t = r_{t-1} P^\beta_t\epsilon_t, r_{t-1}=w_{t-1} P^\alpha_{t-1}, w_{t-1} = A \zeta_{t-1}$)
První způsob je jednodušší, ale může nás dostat do mínusu, druhej je krkolomnější.

Pokud se ale vzdáme interakcí mezi $X$ a $Y$, a budeme předpokládat 
$$
X_t=a X_{t-1} p_{t-1}^\beta p_t^\gamma\epsilon_t
$$
(podobně $Y$), pak je to celkem elegantní, protože se to dá přepsat jako $x_t=\log a + x_{t-1} + \alpha P_{t-1} + \beta P_t +\varepsilon_t$  kde $x_t=\log X_t$. (Samozřejmě by bylo skvělý mít koeficient i u $x_{t-1}$, ale to bhžl nejde).

Ve všech případech může být reziduum korelované (takže přírůstky $X$ mohou přirozeně souviset s přírůstky $Y$).

\end{itemize}
